For more information about what's happening \-\-verbose can be added
to any command. For much more information \-\-verbose=2 may be used.

Display what version of the application is running on the YubiKey:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-aversion

Generate a new ECC\-P256 key on device in slot 9a, will print the public
key on stdout:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9a \-AECCP256 \-agenerate

Generate a certificate request with public key from stdin, will print
the resulting request on stdout:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9a \-S'/CN=foo/OU=test/O=example.com/' \-averify \\
     \-arequest

Generate a self\-signed certificate with public key from stdin, will print
the certificate, for later import, on stdout:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9a \-S'/CN=bar/OU=test/O=example.com/' \-averify \\
     \-aselfsign

Import a certificate from stdin:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9a \-aimport\-certificate

Set a random chuid, import a key and import a certificate from a PKCS12
file, into slot 9c:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9c \-itest.pfx \-KPKCS12 \-aset\-chuid \\
     \-aimport\-key \-aimport\-cert

Import a certificate which is larger than 2048 bytes and thus requires
compression in order to fit:

  openssl x509 \-in cert.pem \-outform DER | gzip \-9 > der.gz
  yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9c \-ider.gz \-KGZIP \-aimport\-cert

Import a certificate which is larger than 2048 bytes and have the yubico-piv-tool
do the GZIP compression in order to fit:

  yubico\-piv\-tool \-s9c \-icert.pem \-\-compress \-aimport\-cert

Change the management key used for administrative authentication:

   yubico\-piv\-tool \-aset\-mgm\-key

Delete a certificate in slot 9a, with management key being asked for:

  yubico\-piv\-tool \-adelete\-certificate \-s9a \-k

Show some information on certificates and other data:

  yubico\-piv\-tool \-astatus

Read out the certificate from a slot and then run a signature test:

  yubico\-piv\-tool \-aread\-cert \-s9a
  yubico\-piv\-tool \-averify\-pin \-atest\-signature \-s9a

Import a key into slot 85 (only available on YubiKey 4) and set the
touch policy (also only available on YubiKey 4):

  yubico-piv-tool \-aimport\-key \-s85 \-\-touch-policy=always \-ikey.pem
