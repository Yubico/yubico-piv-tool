== Yubico PIV Tool

=== Introduction
The Yubico PIV tool is used for interacting with the Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) application on a https://www.yubico.com[YubiKey].

With it you may generate keys on the device, importing keys and
certificates, and create certificate requests, and other operations.
A shared library and a command-line tool is included.

==== Usage guides
For information and examples on what you can do with a PIV enabled YubiKey,

=== Building on POSIX platforms
Either clone from Git or download and unpackage the tarball, then make 
sure you have the pre-requisites installed and build following the 
steps below from the `yubico-piv-tool` directory.

Please make sure to have recent versions of the following packages 
installed on your system. 

  cmake libtool libssl-dev pkg-config check libpcsclite-dev gengetopt help2man zlib-devel

Help2man is used to generate the manpages.  
Gengetopt version 2.22.6 or later is needed for command line parameter 
handling. The 
link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/tree/master/vagrant/development[Vagrant
VM] has all these dependencies preinstalled.

Please note that these package names are debian based. Other POSIX plarforms might have
different names. For example, `libssl-dev` can probably be replaced with `openssl-devel` and
`libpcsclite-dev` can probably be replaced by `pcsc-lite-devel` on a Redhat platform. Also note
that Gengetopt might not be available on all plarforms and might need to be built from source
(See https://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Installation)

After installation of all dependencies, run the following:

  $ cd yubico-piv-tool
  $ mkdir build; cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

On macos, you might need to point out homebrew openssl version when
running pkg-config.

  $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig" cmake ..

To statically link to OpenSSL (the `libcrypto` library), use the cmake
option `-DOPENSSL_STATIC_LINK=ON`

Don't forget you might need to be root for the last command. On Linux 
it might be needed to update your linked libraries after install

  sudo ldconfig

The backend to use is decided at compile time, see the summary at the
end of the `cmake` output.  Use `-DBACKEND=foo` to choose
backend, replacing `foo` with the backend you want to use.  The backends
available are "pcsc", "macscard" and "winscard" using the PCSC
interface, with slightly different shared library linkage and
header file names: "pcsc" is used under GNU-like systems, "macscard"
under Mac OS X, and "winscard" is used under Windows.  In most
situations, running `cmake` should automatically find the proper
backend to use.

=== Building on Windows

Traditionally, building on Windows requires MSBuild or Visual Studio
and the MSVC compiler. Alternatively, you may consider
https://msys2.org[MSYS2].

==== Using MSVC compiler

This scenario requires building the binaries from the
https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/Releases/[source release] package and not from the source
checked out from the repository on GitHub. This is because some files that are part of the command line shell
are generated but they cannot, currently, be generated on Windows. Those files are, however, included in the
source release package.

On Windows, `getopt` is needed to read command line arguments. To install `getopt` along with other
dependencies, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/overview[`vcpkg` package manager] is
used. You will need to install vcpkg and set VCPKG_ROOT environment variable. All dependencies will be build
and installed automatically.

If you would like to build against existing OpenSSL installation, you would have to remove that library from
vcpkg.json manifest and specify the path to OpenSSL either as a command line argument to `cmake` or by setting
the environment variable `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`.

To run the tests, `check` is used. `libykpiv.dll` and `libykcs11.dll` need to be in the `PATH` as well as
other dependencies. The command line examples bellow are for `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022`.

    $ cd yubico-piv-tool-x.y.z
    $ cmake -A x64 -S. -Bbuild
    $ cmake --build build
    $ $env:Path +=";$(Resolve-path build\lib\Debug);$(Resolve-Path build\ykcs11\Debug)"
    $ ctest -C Debug --test-dir build

For building on 32 bits system, use `-A Win32`.

==== MSYS2

The steps are very similar to those for POSIX with the exception for names of dependency packages. Launch your
preferred https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/[MSYS2 environment] and make sure dependencies are
installed. Here is example for UCRT64 environment. Note that `gengetopt` belongs to MSYS (cygwin) environment.

    $ pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-ninja mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cc mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-zlib mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-check gengetopt
    $ cd yubico-piv-tool
    $ cmake -GNinja -S. -Bbuild
    $ cmake --build build
    $ cmake --build build --target test

Note that you may use git repo and not only the source release when using MSYS2. Furthermore, upon configuring
the build system, all necessary files for Visual C compiler will be generated.

==== Coverage

Code coverage is provided courtesy of lcov and https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/CMake-codecov[CMake-codecov]. This currently only works with `make`.

Enable coverage with

 $ cmake -DENABLE_COVERAGE=1 ..

You can then build the project normally and run some executables (for example running the tests with `make test`).

At this point coverage evaluation can be generated with gcov/lcov related targets. For example

 $ make lcov

will generate a single HTML report in `./lcov/html/all_targets/index.html`

=== Portability
The main development platform is Debian GNU/Linux.
The project compiles on Windows using MSVC and the PCSC backend.
It can also be built for Mac OS X, also using the PCSC backend.

=== Example Usage
For a list of all available options --help can be given. For more information
on exactly what happens --verbose or --verbose=2 may be added.

Generate a new ECC-P256 key on device in slot 9a, will print the public
key on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -AECCP256 -agenerate

Generate a certificate request with public key from stdin, will print
the resulting request on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=foo/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify-pin -arequest

Generate a self-signed certificate with public key from stdin, will print
the certificate, for later import, on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=bar/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify-pin -aselfsign

Import a certificate from stdin:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -aimport-certificate

Set a random chuid, import a key and import a certificate from a PKCS12
file, into slot 9c:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9c -itest.pfx -KPKCS12 -aset-chuid -aimport-key \
    -aimport-cert

Change the management key used for administrative authentication:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aset-mgm-key

Delete a certificate in slot 9a, with management key being asked for:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -adelete-certificate -s9a -k

Show some information on certificates and other data:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -astatus

Read out the certificate from a slot and then run a signature test:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aread-cert -s9a
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -atest-signature -s9a

Import a key into slot 85 (only available on YubiKey 4 & 5) and set the
touch policy (also only available on YubiKey 4 & 5):

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aimport-key -s85 --touch-policy=always -ikey.pem
