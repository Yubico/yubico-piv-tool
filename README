== Yubico PIV Tool

=== Introduction
The Yubico PIV tool is used for interacting with the Personal
Identity Verification (PIV) application on a https://www.yubico.com[YubiKey].

With it you may generate keys on the device, importing keys and
certificates, and create certificate requests, and other operations.
A shared library and a command-line tool is included.

==== Usage guides
For information and examples on what you can do with a PIV enabled YubiKey,
see https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/

=== Building on POSIX platforms
Either clone from Git or download and unpackage the tarball, then make 
sure you have the pre-requisites installed and build following the 
steps below from the `yubico-piv-tool` directory.

Please make sure to have recent versions of the following packages 
installed on your system. 

  cmake libtool libssl-dev pkg-config check libpcsclite-dev gengetopt help2man

Help2man is used to generate the manpages.  
Gengetopt version 2.22.6 or later is needed for command line parameter 
handling. The 
link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/tree/master/vagrant/development[Vagrant
VM] has all these dependencies preinstalled.

  $ mkdir build; cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

On macos, you might need to point out homebrew openssl version when
running pkg-config.

  $ PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1/lib/pkgconfig" cmake ..

To statically link to OpenSSL (the `libcrypto` library), use the cmake
option `-DOPENSSL_STATIC_LINK=ON`

Don't forget you might need to be root for the last command. On Linux 
it might be needed to update your linked libraries after install

  sudo ldconfig

The backend to use is decided at compile time, see the summary at the
end of the `cmake` output.  Use `--with-backend=foo` to choose
backend, replacing `foo` with the backend you want to use.  The backends
available are "pcsc", "macscard" and "winscard" using the PCSC
interface, with slightly different shared library linkage and
header file names: "pcsc" is used under GNU-like systems, "macscard"
under Mac OS X, and "winscard" is used under Windows.  In most
situations, running `cmake` should automatically find the proper
backend to use.

=== Building on Windows

Building on Windows requires MSBuild or Visual Studio and the MSVC compiler. It also requires
building the binaries from the https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/Releases/[source release] package
and not from the source checked out from the repository on GitHub. This is because some files that are part of
the command line shell are generated but they cannot, currently, be generated on Windows. Those files are, however,
included in the source release package.

On Windows, `getopt` is needed to read command line arguments. The easiest way to install `getopt`
is with the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vcpkg?view=msvc-160[`vcpkg` package manager]. The
path to `getopt` DLL library and include file need to be specified as a command line argument to `cmake`.
Also the path to OpenSSL needs to be specified either as a command line argument to `cmake`
or by setting the environment variable `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`

The command line examples bellow are for `PowerShell` and the prerequisites were installed from source (using `vcpkg`).

    $ env:OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR ="PATH/TO/OPENSSL_DIR"
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake -A <ARCH> -DGETOPT_LIB_DIR="PATH/TO/GETOPT_DIR/lib" -DGETOPT_INCLUDE_DIR="PATH/TO/GETOPT_DIR/include ..
    $ cmake --build .

To run the tests, `check` is used. The path to the `check` directory needs to be
specified as a command line argument to `cmake`. Also the path to `check` binaries,
`OpenSSL` binaries, `libykpiv.dll` and `libykcs11.dll` need to be in the `PATH`

    $ env:OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR ="PATH/TO/OPENSSL_DIR"
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake -A <ARCH> -DGETOPT_LIB_DIR="PATH/TO/GETOPT_DIR/lib" -DGETOPT_INCLUDE_DIR="PATH/TO/GETOPT_DIR/include -DCHECK_PATH="PATH/TO/CHECK_DIR" ..
    $ cmake --build .
    $ $env:Path +=";PATH/TO//CHECK_DIR/bin;PATH/TO/OPENSSL_DIR/bin;PATH/TO/build\lib\Debug;PATH/TO/build\ykcs11\Debug"
    $ ctest.exe -C Debug

For building on 32 bits system, use `Win32` as ARCH. For building on 64 bits systems,
use `x64` as ARCH.

==== Coverage

Code coverage is provided courtesy of lcov and https://github.com/RWTH-HPC/CMake-codecov[CMake-codecov]. This currently only works with `make`.

Enable coverage with

 $ cmake -DENABLE_COVERAGE=1 ..

You can then build the project normally and run some executables (for example running the tests with `make test`).

At this point coverage evaluation can be generated with gcov/lcov related targets. For example

 $ make lcov

will generate a single HTML report in `./lcov/html/all_targets/index.html`

=== Portability
The main development platform is Debian GNU/Linux.
The project compiles on Windows using MSVC and the PCSC backend.
It can also be built for Mac OS X, also using the PCSC backend.

=== Example Usage
For a list of all available options --help can be given. For more information
on exactly what happens --verbose or --verbose=2 may be added.

Generate a new ECC-P256 key on device in slot 9a, will print the public
key on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -AECCP256 -agenerate

Generate a certificate request with public key from stdin, will print
the resulting request on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=foo/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify -arequest

Generate a self-signed certificate with public key from stdin, will print
the certificate, for later import, on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=bar/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify -aselfsign

Import a certificate from stdin:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -aimport-certificate

Set a random chuid, import a key and import a certificate from a PKCS12
file, into slot 9c:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9c -itest.pfx -KPKCS12 -aset-chuid -aimport-key \
    -aimport-cert

Change the management key used for administrative authentication:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aset-mgm-key

Delete a certificate in slot 9a, with management key being asked for:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -adelete-certificate -s9a -k

Show some information on certificates and other data:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -astatus

Read out the certificate from a slot and then run a signature test:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aread-cert -s9a
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -atest-signature -s9a

Import a key into slot 85 (only available on YubiKey 4 & 5) and set the
touch policy (also only available on YubiKey 4 & 5):

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aimport-key -s85 --touch-policy=always -ikey.pem
