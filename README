== Yubico PIV Tool

=== Introduction
The Yubico PIV tool is used for interacting with the Privilege and
Identification Card (PIV) application on a https://www.yubico.com[YubiKey].

With it you may generate keys on the device, importing keys and
certificates, and create certificate requests, and other operations.
A shared library and a command-line tool is included.

==== Usage guides
For information and examples on what you can do with a PIV enabled YubiKey,
see https://developers.yubico.com/PIV/

=== Building
After downloading and unpacking the package tarball, you build it as
follows.

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

The backend to use is decided at compile time, see the summary at the
end of the ./configure output.  Use --with-backend=foo to chose
backend, replacing foo with the backend you want to use.  The backends
available are "pcsc", "macscard", and "winscard" using the PCSC
interface, with slightly different shared library linkage and
header file names: "pcsc" is used under GNU-like systems, "macscard"
under Mac OS X, and "winscard" is used under Windows.  In most
situations, running ./configure should automatically find the proper
backend to use.

=== Building from Git
Recent versions of autoconf, automake, check, pkg-config, and libtool
must be installed.  Help2man is used to generate the manpages.  Gengetopt
version 2.22.6 or later is needed for command line parameter handling.
The
link:https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/tree/master/vagrant/development[Vagrant
VM] has all these dependencies preinstalled.

Generate the build system using:

  $ autoreconf --install

Then you follow the normal build instructions, see above.
To turn on all warnings add --enable-gcc-warnings to ./configure

=== Portability
The main development platform is Debian GNU/Linux.  The project is
cross-compiled to Windows using MinGW (see windows.mk) using the PCSC
backend.  It may also be built for Mac OS X (see mac.mk), also using
the PCSC backend.

=== Example Usage
For a list of all available options --help can be given. For more information
on exactly what happens --verbose or --verbose=2 may be added.

Generate a new ECC-P256 key on device in slot 9a, will print the public
key on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -AECCP256 -agenerate

Generate a certificate request with public key from stdin, will print
the resulting request on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=foo/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify -arequest

Generate a self-signed certificate with public key from stdin, will print
the certificate, for later import, on stdout:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -S'/CN=bar/OU=test/O=example.com/' -averify -aselfsign

Import a certificate from stdin:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9a -aimport-certificate

Set a random chuid, import a key and import a certificate from a PKCS12
file, into slot 9c:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -s9c -itest.pfx -KPKCS12 -aset-chuid -aimport-key \
    -aimport-cert

Change the management key used for administrative authentication:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aset-mgm-key

Delete a certificate in slot 9a, with management key being asked for:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -adelete-certificate -s9a -k

Show some information on certificates and other data:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -astatus

Read out the certificate from a slot and then run a signature test:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aread-cert -s9a
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -atest-signature -s9a

Import a key into slot 85 (only available on YubiKey 4) and set the
touch policy (also only available on YubiKey 4):

  $ yubico-piv-tool -aimport-key -s85 --touch-policy=always -ikey.pem
