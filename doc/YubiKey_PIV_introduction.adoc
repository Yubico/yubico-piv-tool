== Yubico PIV Tool
The YubiKey supports the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card
interface specified in NIST SP 800-73 document "Cryptographic
Algorithms and Key Sizes for PIV".  PIV enables you to perform RSA or
ECC sign/decrypt operations using a private key stored on the
smartcard, through common interfaces like PKCS#11.  This project
contain the library, tools and PKCS#11 module to interact with the
hardware functionality.

=== General information
The default PIN code is 123456.  The default PUK code is 12345678.

For firmware 5.7 and above:
The default AES-192 management key (9B) is
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708.

For firmware 5.4 and below:
The default 3DES management key (9B) is
010203040506070801020304050607080102030405060708.

The following key slots exists:

* 9A, 9C, 9D, 9E: RSA 1024, RSA 2048, ECC secp256r1 or ECC secp384r1 keys
  (algorithms 6, 7, 11 respectively).

* 9B: Triple-DES key (algorithm 3) for PIV management.

The maximum size of stored objects is 2025/3049 bytes for current versions of
YubiKey NEO and YubiKey 4, respectively.

Currently all functionality are available over both contact and
contactless interfaces (contrary to what the specifications mandate).

=== Preparing a YubiKey for real use
You would typically change the management key to make sure nobody but
you can modify the state of the PIV application on the YubiKey.  Make sure to
keep a copy of the key around for later use.
All of these invocations will leave traces of keys and pins in the command line
history, this can be avoided by leaving the argument out all-together and the
software will ask for key/pin to be input. For the management key option (-k)
this is achieved by leaving out the value but will specifying -k.

  $ key=$(export LC_CTYPE=C; dd if=/dev/urandom 2>/dev/null | tr -d '[:lower:]' | tr -cd '[:xdigit:]' | fold -w48 | head -1)
  $ echo ${key}
  $ yubico-piv-tool -aset-mgm-key -n${key}

The PIN and PUK should be changed as well.

  $ pin=$(export LC_CTYPE=C; dd if=/dev/urandom 2>/dev/null | tr -cd '[:digit:]' | fold -w6 | head -1)
  $ echo ${pin}

  $ puk=$(export LC_CTYPE=C; dd if=/dev/urandom 2>/dev/null | tr -cd '[:digit:]' | fold -w8 | head -1)
  $ echo ${puk}

  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-pin -P123456 -N${pin}
  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-puk -P12345678 -N${puk}

=== Other useful commands
To generate a new private key:

  $ yubico-piv-tool -k${key} -agenerate -s9c

To reset PIN/PUK retry counter AND codes (default pin 123456 puk
12345678):

  $ yubico-piv-tool -k${key} -averify -P${pin} -apin-retries --pin-retries=3 --puk-retries=3

To reset the application (PIN/PUK need to be blocked hence trying a couple
of times -- you need to modify this if you have changed the default
number of PIN/PUK retries).

  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -P471112
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -P471112
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -P471112
  $ yubico-piv-tool -averify-pin -P471112
  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-puk -P471112 -N6756789
  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-puk -P471112 -N6756789
  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-puk -P471112 -N6756789
  $ yubico-piv-tool -achange-puk -P471112 -N6756789
  $ yubico-piv-tool -areset

=== Software
Card management has been tested with the tools from the OpenSC
project, specifically piv-tool, and Yubico's PIV software (see
below).  Basic features should work with any PIV compliant
middleware.

=== Card Holder Unique Identifier
For the application to be usable in windows the object CHUID (Card Holder
Unique Identifier) has to be set and unique. The card contents are
also aggressively cached so the CHUID has to be changed if the card
contents change.
