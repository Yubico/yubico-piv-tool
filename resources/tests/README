These scripts are just example usage. They are mostly used by developers to test functionality and they require a YubiKey to be plugged in.

WARNING: Data on the YubiKey will be overwritten.

Running BATS script on Windows through MSYS2:
In order to run the BATS (bash automated testing system) scripts you need to follow the steps below.
If you only did "git clone" to get this repository you also need to do "git submodule update --init --recursive" in order for the BATS submodlues to load correctly

Install MSYS2:
-   Download the installer through "https://www.msys2.org/" and run the MSYS terminal (default is UCRT64).
You may need to do a system update with the command "pacman -Syu" and close then reopen the terminal.

Download BATS:
-   Create a directory in which you will download the bats-core source code.
-   Clone the repository "git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git"
-   Run the installation script "cd bats-core" and "./install.sh /usr/local"
-   Verify that BATS was correctly installed with "bats --version"

Install dependencies:
-   If "diffutils" and "openssl" aren't already installed on your system install them
-   Can check if installed by "diff --version" and "openssl --version"
-   If not installed, install with "pacman -S diffutils openssl"

Run the tests:
-   In the MSYS terminal change directory into (your path)/yubico-piv-tool/resources/tests
-   Run test with "bats cmdline_tests.bats"
-   You can modify the test with the following environment variables:
YUBICO_PIV_TOOL: Path to the yubico-piv-tool executable. (only change this if you encounter errors)
SLOTS_MODE: Which slots to test ('ac', 'acde', or 'all'). Defaults to 'ac'
ENC_MODE: Set to 'enc' to run tests over an encrypted channel.

example: "SLOTS_MODE=all bats cmdline_tests.bats"

In order to run the ykcs11 tests there are some additional things to do.
-   Install OpenSC to your system 
-   Run test with "bats ykcs11_tests.bats"
-   You can modify the test with the following environment variables:
SLOTS_MODE: Which slots to run tests on: 'ac' runs tests on slots 9a and 9c, 'acde' runs tests on slots 9a, 9c, 9d and 9e, 'all' runs tests on all slots"
MODULE: Path to PKCS11 module.
PKCS11_TOOL:   path to pkcs11-tool binary.
EDIT_PATH: Adds BOTH the pkcs11-tool binary and libykpiv module to path, only edit this if they aren't downloaded on default locations, using ":" as delimiter
